This homework assignment is done for the course System Validation. Here has been practiced with JML Annotations, Runtime Assertion Checking(from now on called RAC), Static Checking and Test Generation. In the first part JML annotations were made for informal array requirements. In the second part a game of Sokoban was used where informal requirements were made formal and were checked by JML Annotations, RAC, Static Checking and Test Generation. In the end the program behaved accordingly to the informal requirements.
